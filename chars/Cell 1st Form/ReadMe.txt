Character Information:
	Cell also considered to be Android 21, was a creation of Dr. Gero's. Cell's purpose seemed to be achieving "perfection", 
attainable only after absorbing Android #17 and Android #18. Cell's main source of power is other people, basically he absorbs
countless civilians to gain strength. Cell also has the abilities of most other DBZ characters, making him weak against none.
Insect form Cell has more of a hit and run approach, basically he will attack the weak or helpless, then run from the before 
the heroes can stop him. 

Fun facts: -When Cell absorbs 18 it's somewhat arousing. 
	   -His tail looks like it would be great in a hentai film.
           -My brother once asked years ago, why Cell had a condom on his tail.
           -This one time I accidentally greeted someone with the line "Thank you very much." Confusion ensued.
           -Insect form Cell and Zorak from Cartoon Planet and other shows have curious similarities in voice.
           -Cell once littered and wiped his mouth with the American flag. He is still not Dennis Leary.
           -You can find nude pics of Cell at this website. http://www.oh wait hes already naked.com/
           -Cell's Solar Flare and Special Beam Cannon sound rips actually have background noise and music. 
                 I drowned it out with other sound so you can't actually tell!
