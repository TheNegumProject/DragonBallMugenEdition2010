[Options]
 ;Here you set the maximum number of matches to fight before game ends
 ;in Arcade Mode. The first number is the number of matches against
 ;characters with order=1, followed by order=2 and order=3 respectively.
 ;For example, for 4,3,1 you will fight up to 4 randomly-picked
 ;characters who have order=1, followed by 3 with order=2 and 1 with
 ;order=3.
arcade.maxmatches = 4,3,3,1,1


 ;Maximum number of matches to fight before game ends in Team Mode.
 ;Like arcade.maxmatches, but applies to Team Battle.
team.maxmatches = 4,3,3,1,1

team.arcade.maxmatches = 4,3,3,1,1
team.versus.maxmatches = 4,3,3,1,1
